In light of the increasing appreciation of environmental management being critical to economic and social welfare in Ghana, and throughout Africa, **Resource Transformation Ghana (RTG)** was established in 2018 to provide consultancy services to environmental sector stakeholders with sustainability-related interests in Africa. We work with businesses, think tanks, private equity firms, non-profits, governmental bodies and international development agencies.

As a boutique environmental consultancy focusing on waste management and circular economy, we strive to help our clients to achieve the following goals:
* Understanding Africa's circular economy and resource/waste management dynamics
* Identifying most promising avenues for improving resource/waste management
* Minimising environmental impact while simultaneously improving operational efficiency and profitability

We assist our clients with realising these objectives by providing stellar expertise in data analytics, technical advisory and project management. By leveraging our industry insights and relationships in Africa and Europe, we help our clients to develop resilient circular economy based business models for the African market. Together we can transform the environmental challenges into growth opportunities, and turn the difficult task of developing fit-for-purpose solutions into an exciting journey.

  title: Why is this urgent?
  text: The World Bank estimated that 1.6 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions (about 5 percent of global emissions) were generated from solid waste treatment and disposal in 2016. Diseases related to mismanaged waste result in 700,000 deaths each year. This is why changing waste management practices is an urgent matter.

Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. 
Our current focus is on marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter. 
About {{site.data.language.percentage_of_plastic_pollution_originating_on_land}} of plastic pollution that ends up in our oceans originates on land, a lot of it is due to the lack of waste collection services in populated areas. 
This brings us to Indonesia, where about {{site.data.language.percentage_of_plastic_pollution_originating_in_indonesia}} of global marine plastic pollution originates. 
Our initial goal is to improve coverage and efficiency of the waste collection and treatment system, since only {{site.data.language.percentage_of_msw_collected_in_indonesia}} of municipal solid waste is currently collected in Indonesia.
